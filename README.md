## Analysis
1. Open code/Weather_Data.ipynb
2. Run all cells in order
    - Load and inspect data set
    - Convert data types of columns of the data frames to the correct type
    - Clean Data (Removing unnecessary parts)
    - Impute missing data (NaN values)
    - Join the Seattle and New York City data frames [Date], [Precipitation]
    - Ensure using tidy
    - Rename columns
    - Create data visualizations
